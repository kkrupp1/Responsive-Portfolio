Homework 1 - That Portfolio Though

To whoever is grading this, I am sorry for putting you through this. I WILL GET BETTER!


There is abosuletly zero documentation/notes and probably a lot of inefficienies. I had a crazy week and contrary to what my bio says I am also a huge hypocrite. I really should have commited more time to this.

I do think this was a fun assignment however! Definitley can see why we do this before moving onto bootstrap. 

The mattress gif really about CSS was oh so relevant to me with this assignment... mainly why I sort of gave up on the Portofilio page :( I'm sure all I had to do was another class or two to get that working, or maybe I have too many classes as is? Probably. 

Anyways, I'm really open to criticism and aside from everything that is missing from this assigment I open feedback on what I could have done better on the things that do "work". 



Godspeed.

- K.K.
