            <p>I am young professional currently in the SaaS industry for Market Research. 
                I graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in Information Systems Management & Business Analytics, and Business Management. 
                My career sand personality have recently led me to gain a strong interest in web development. 
                I enjoy creating things. Solving complex problems gives me such a rush and keeps me going. </p>


            <p>In my free time I’m always discovering new hobbies. My most recent endeavors include snow skiing and golfing. Next up is most likely photography. 
                Whenever I try something new, I commit whole heartedly to it and really give it my all. 
                I’ve always been described as a quick learner; maybe I am just skilled at many, master of none – but I digress. 
                What I’m most passionate about is music. I’ve always been fascinated with sound and rhythm. 
                I never learned how to read music, but I’d love to pick up an instrument someday. 
                Maybe that will be my next pursuit after photography!</p>
